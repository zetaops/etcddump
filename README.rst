etcddump
========

A dump &amp; load tool for etcd, which respects all key properties (including indexes) of public keys.

Fork from original, fixed utf-8 encoded keys and values.

Installation
------------

You can install etcddump from sources by cloning this repository and run

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo python setup.py install
-
Alternatively you may use pip:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo pip install etcddump



After you've installed etcddump, the program ``etcdumper`` will be available on your system

The only dependency of ``etcddump`` is  `python-ectd <https://github.com/jplana/python-etcd>`_ version 0.3.0 or later.

Usage
-----

Usage is really simple and has been thought so that it resembles how most dumper programs work.

.. code:: bash

    # dump to stdout
    etcdumper dump https://etcd.example.com:4001

    # dump to file
    etcdumper --file dump.json dump https://etcd.example.com:4001

    # restore from file
    etcdumper --file dump.json restore http://localhost:4001

    # try to maintain the same indexes as in the original cluster
    etcdumper --file dump.json --preserve-indexes restore https://etcd.example.com:4001

    #dump & restore in one command using pipes
    etcdumper dump https://etcd.example.com:4001 | etcdumper restore http://localhost:4001


Docker
------
You can use etcdumper with ``docker run`` command. It is same syntax, just replace ``etcdumper`` with 
``docker run zetaops/etcdumper``. Or simply define an alias: ``alias etcdumper='docker run zetaops/etcdumper'``

.. code:: bash

    # dump to stdout
    docker run zetaops/etcdumper dump https://etcd.example.com:4001
